Event organizers can effortlessly control the process remotely, saving time and enhancing the overall inauguration experience.

LIMITATION :
Complexity and expertise required for setup.
2. Ongoing maintenance needs to ensure the proper functioning of hardware components.

3. Scalability challenges particularly in handling larger or more complex curtain arrangements
